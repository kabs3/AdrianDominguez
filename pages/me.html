		 						<h3>Who i am?</h3>
		 						<br>
		 						<p class="lead">
		 							My name is Adrián, I was born and raised in Mexico City, I am the youngest of five brothers.
		 							<br>
		 							I am a sociable person, I like to work with a good team. I am persevering in my work and school
		 							<br>
		 							I like everything that has to do with technology and new trends. Above all get knowledge and apply it but never stop learning.
		 							<br>
		 							When I finished high school I did not continue with my education and I got to work for three years as a data capturist in Cosmocolor S.A. de C.V., work in which I managed to perform until I got the post of person in charge of a credentials module. However, I realized that I wanted something more than that job and that's when I decided to resume my studies in 2014, entering the engineering faculty of the UNAM in the mining and metallurgical engineering career, but I did not like this career. I did an admission exam for the Computer Engineering course.
		 							During my stay in the faculty, I have worked as a teacher in mathematics and physics to be able to pay some expenses.
